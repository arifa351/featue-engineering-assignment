What is a parameter?\n","\n","- In Machine Learning, a parameter is an internal variable of a model that is learned from training data. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept are parameters.\n","\n","### 2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n","- Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1.\n","\n","- A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, more study time might correlate negatively with the number of errors in a test.\n","\n","### 3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n","\n","- Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.\n","\n","- Main components:\n","\n"," - Data\n","\n"," - Model\n","\n"," - Loss Function\n","\n"," - Optimizer\n","\n"," - Evaluation Metrics\n","\n","### 4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n","\n","- Loss value measures the error between the predicted and actual outputs. A lower loss indicates a better-performing model.\n","\n","### 5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n","\n","- Continuous variables: Numerical values that can take any number (e.g., weight, age).\n","\n","- Categorical variables: Represent categories (e.g., gender, city).\n","\n","### 6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n","\n","- Techniques include:\n","\n"," - Label Encoding\n","\n"," - One-Hot Encoding\n","\n"," - Ordinal Encoding\n","\n","- These convert categories into numbers so models can use them.\n","\n","### 7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n","\n","- Training data is used to train the model.\n","\n","- Testing data is used to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n","\n","### 8.

Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n","\n","- EDA helps:\n","\n"," - Understand data distribution\n","\n"," - Detect missing/outlier values\n","\n"," - Discover relationships and patterns\n","\n"," - Decide which features to use or transform\n","\n","### 12. What is correlation?\n","\n","- Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1.\n","\n","### 13. What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n","- A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, more study time might correlate negatively with the number of errors in a test.\n","\n","### 14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n","\n","- Using pandas:\n","\n"," - df.corr()\n","\n"," - import seaborn as sns\n"," - sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)\n","\n","### 15. What is causation? Explain the difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n","\n","- Causation means one variable directly affects another.\n","\n","- Correlation means two variables move together but not necessarily due to cause-effect.\n","\n","- Example:\n"," - Ice cream sales and drowning rates correlate (both increase in summer), but one doesn't cause the other.\n","\n","### 16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n","\n","- An optimizer updates model parameters to minimize the loss.\n","\n","- Common types:\n","\n"," - SGD: Basic optimizer using gradient descent.\n","\n"," - Adam: Combines momentum and RMSprop.\n","\n"," - RMSprop: Maintains learning rates using a moving average of gradients.\n","\n"," - optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\n","\n","### 17.
